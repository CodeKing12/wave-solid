I implemented Spatial Navigation in the AVPlayer component, separated the main controls from the rest of the player for better navigation implementation, split the PlayerUtilities file, made the Speed, Subtitle and Audio controls smarter to adapt to cases where they are hidden/out-of-sight. I also made a few UI adjustments and made the tsconfig file use the default lib, target, and module valeues.
